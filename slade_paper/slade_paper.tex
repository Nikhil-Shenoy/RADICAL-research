% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else

% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:

% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.

% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan

\begin{abstract}
Much of today's scientific experiments have become computation driven, and the amount of data that needs to be processed can be very large. Traditional data processing techniques relied on scheduling tasks directly through the job scheduler on a cluster, and then running the job using a Message Passing library to achieve the desired parallelism. However, many drawbacks were discovered with this approach, with the most prominent being extended wait times for jobs in the scheduling queue. This problem, coupled with scientists' increasing demand for fast, responsive simulations, has led to inefficient systems and a lack of progress. 

This research seeks to eliminate the drawbacks of traditional processing methods by utilizing an existing Pilot-Job system, RADICAL-Pilot, to process problems in molecular dynamics. The resultant software, the EnsembleMD Toolkit, is designed to to efficiently manage and assign tasks to distributed resources using Pilots, and to abstract the details of resource management away from the user. Such an abstraction will allow the user to focus on the science of his simulation rather than the complexities of running the simulation. Specifically, this work analyzes the performance of EnsembleMD modules and details the development of additional modules for the API.

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart
% This demo file is intended to serve as a ``starter file''
% for IEEE conference papers produced under \LaTeX\ using
% IEEEtran.cls version 1.8b and later.
% % You must have at least 2 lines in the paragraph with the drop letter
% % (should never be an issue)
% I wish you the best of success.

% Briefly describe how traditional systems work
Traditional distributed systems utilize batch queueing systems in order to schedule jobs to the system's resources. In such systems, scripts are written to execute several different tasks sequentially, and a scheduler assigns the tasks the resources it requires. The problem with this approach is that since a task will most likely require only a fraction of the available resources, the remainder remains idle. Leaving cores unutilized severely limits the efficiency and throughput of the system and must be avoided. Additionally, the scheduler does not account for attributes specific to the application, which include the number of cores, the size of the task, and whether the task has multi-threaded, multi-process, or serial execution. These problems are carried with the user who, in many cases, is attempting to run computation-heavy scientific simulations.

% Introduce the necessity of EnsembleMD here



To alleviate this problem, the concept of Pilot-Jobs was introduced. 

% Briefly describe how pilots work
A pilot job is a special type of container designed to process and manage several different tasks during its lifetime. In traditional processing schemes, a job generally consists of running the same executable repeatedly with varying parameters, with each instance becoming a process that is submitted to the scheduler. Each of these instances must wait to have their resource requests fulfilled and then be correctly scheduled in order to execute. In a pilot scheme, information about each instance is associated with the pilot, and only the pilot is placed into the scheduling queue. Once the scheduler schedules the pilot, it then establishes communication with the user and accepts tasks. The user can now schedule tasks directly to the pilot, which then runs the task using a portion of its allocated resources, assuming that the task's resource requirement does not exceed the amount of available resources. If resources are still available after the scheduling of the initial task, the pilot will accept additional tasks and schedule them to those resources. The user can continue to schedule tasks to the pilot until the wall time of the pilot expires.

The main advantage in using a pilot system is that one can circumvent the scheduler when running multiple tasks. By placing only the pilot into the scheduling queue, the user obviates the time necessary to request and assign resources for the total number of tasks. This can result in a decreased time-to-completion for each task, and high throughput of the number of tasks. More importantly, such a scheme leads to efficient usage of resources, as not only can a single pilot keep its local resources occupied for long periods of time, but a series of pilots can ensures that a large percentage of the entire grid's resources are kept busy. Since the submission of the pilot and its workload is decoupled from the assignment of resources, complex applications can be written to take advantage of all the resources in the system.

% Brief description on the usage of pilot systems?
% Describe how RADICAL-Pilot works
\subsection{RADICAL-Pilot}
RADICAL-Pilot (RP) is an implementation of a pilot-job system created by the RADICAL-Cybertools research group, and is utilized by the EnsembleMD Toolkit. RP consists of three main components; the Compute Unit, the Pilot, and the Agent. These components are abstractions for the task of a workload, the resource placeholder, and component of a pilot that manages the execution of units. The Compute Unit and the Pilot are designed as stateful entities, and the Agent is responsible for shepherding them through the different states. 

At any given time, the Pilot is in one of the following states: New, Pending\_Launch, Launching, Pending\_Active, Active, Done, Cancelled, or Failed. Naturally, a Pilot begins in the New state when it is created. Once the Pilot has been instantiated, internal modules change the Pilot's state to Pending\_Launch, and after being placed in the queue, to Launching. The scheduler will then schedule the Pilot as it would any other normal job, and the Pilot's state is changed to Pending\_Active. After the Pilot has been granted its resources, it starts the Agent and changes its status to Active. In this state, the Pilot will continue to accept tasks from the application and schedule them efficiently across the given resources until no more tasks remain. At this point, the Pilot can be in either Done, Cancelled, or Failed. Clearly, the Pilot will be Done if all tasks have executed without any errors. If the Agent is interrupted, such as with the interrupt signal, then the Pilot will become Cancelled. If an error occurs, the Agent changes the Pilot state to Failed and stops execution.

Compute Units have a similar set of states. A Compute Unit can take on one of the following states: New, UMGR\_Scheduling, UMGR\_Staging\_Input, Agent\_Staging\_Input, Agent\_Scheduling, Executing, Agent\_Staging\_Output, UMGR\_Staging\_Output, Done, Cancelled, Failed. The UMGR in the state names stands for the Unit Manager which, true to its name, manages units and what Pilots they are associated with. This occurs in the UMGR\_Scheduling phase, after the Compute Unit is instantiated in the New state. In the UMGR\_Staging\_Input phase, the Compute Unit's state transitions differ from that of the Pilot; since the Compute Unit represents the task to be executed, it must receive all the input it needs in order to run. During this phase, the Compute Unit receives the name of the executable, command line parameters, input datafiles, and any other information. The Agent ensures that the input staging occurs properly in the Agent\_Staging phase and begins executing the task on a portion of the resources in the Executing state. Once the task finishes executing, the Agent\_Staging\_Output and UMGR\_Staging\_Output states gather any output data and returns it to the application. Finally, the Compute Unit enters one of the three final states in the same way that the Pilot does.

% Describe what you are going to be talking about in your paper.
\subsection{EnsembleMD Toolkit}
  
% Background on molecular dynamics, and then a brief survey of existing MD technologies and why they are inadequate
The molecular dynamics community works on simulating the interactions of atoms and molecules, which can be generally classified as N-body problems. To run these simulations, the scientists must submit their tasks to distributed computing resources (DCRs) using software specifically designed for their experiments. There are many such softwares throughout the community, but since there is no standard that integrates all the functionalities into a single framework, progress is hindered due to a lack of portability and extensibility. The absence of this standard prevents scientists from adapting to and creating new simulation patterns, leading to the larger problem of unscalable software. 

Heterogeniety of DCRs compound this problem. Execution of a task on a DCR requires an intimate knowledge of all available resources; each instance of the existing molecular dynamics software is designed for at most a handful of resources, and the architectures of all of those systems can differ. Introducing a new DCR into the software could require a scientist to restructure major components, inevitably leading to additional bugs, and would cost the scientist time and funding for the project. 

In this paper, we present the EnsembleMD Toolkit as a solution to these problems. The Toolkit is centered around the concept of an ensemble, which is defined as task consisting of several simulations with different input parameters. Using the ensemble as the primary entity, our software provides three unique features:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
  \item Instantiation of ensembles is separated from the simulation tool
  \item Execution patterns based on ensembles
  \item Decoupling of pattern execution from pattern expression
  \item Dynamic execution on a range of DCRs using the RADICAL-Pilot API
\end{enumerate}
% Enter EnMD. How does it solve the problem?

% Describe the EnMD architecture



% The introduction section should give a brief background on how RADICAL-Pilot works and how EnsembleMD works. There will probably need to be a little more than that here.

% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.
