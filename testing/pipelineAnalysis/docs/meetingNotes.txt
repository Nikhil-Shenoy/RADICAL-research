- Need end-user model that demonstrates ENMD's capabilities
- Measure same workload across all patterns
- Plot them the same way
- Start with zero data, zero waittime and scale it up
- Run the simulations using Stampede
- Scale to 128 cores, 1000 if you can
- Use ENMD mailing list to update team on the experiments
- Task should take approximately 15 minutes to run
- Weekly updates to the mailing list on progress
